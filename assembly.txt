DATA REGISTERS
	=>  8-bit	data registers: AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL.
	=>  16-bit	data registers: AX, BX, CX and DX.
	=>  32-bit	data registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX.

	AX	=> 	accumulator
	BX	=>	base
	CX	=>	counter
	DX	=>	data

	AX is the primary accumulator it is used in input/output and most arithmetic instructions
		EXEMPLE:  in multiplication operation, one operand is stored in 
		EAX or AX or AL register according to the size of the operand.
	
	BX is known as the base register,
		as it could be used in indexed addressing.

	CX is known as the count register, as the ECX,
		CX registers store the loop count in iterative operations.
	
	DX is known as the data register
		It is also used in input/output operations.
		It is also used with AX register along with DX for multiply
		and divide operations involving large values.

POINTER REGISTERS
	The pointer registers are 32-bit EIP, ESP, and EBP registers
		and corresponding 16-bit right portions IP, SP, and BP.
	There are three categories of pointer registers

		Instruction Pointer (IP)
			The 16-bit IP register stores the offset address of the next instruction to be executed.
			IP in association with the CS register (as CS:IP) gives the complete address of the current
			instruction in the code segment.

		Stack Pointer (SP)
			The 16-bit SP register provides the offset value within the program stack.
			SP in association with the SS register (SS:SP) refers to be current
			position of data or address within the program stack.

		Base Pointer (BP)
		The 16-bit BP register mainly helps in referencing the parameter variables passed to a subroutine.
		The address in SS register is combined with the offset in BP to get the location of the parameter.
		BP can also be combined with DI and SI as base register for special addressing.
